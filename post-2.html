    <h1>The Story of REVV103</h1>
    <h3>Some brands are born from profit. Ours was born from <strong>purpose</strong>.</h3>
    <p>The number 103 isn’t random. It’s a marker of a very precious date, a silent witness to moments that changed everything for our founder, a symbol of new beginnings, quiet resilience and a promise to build something lasting.</p>
    <p>What started as a small idea in a living room by crafting gifts for loved ones (hobby) then grew into WeGoRandom and now officially known as <strong>103 Creations</strong>, a brand that believes every item should mean something. We don’t just sell products. We engrave stories, bottle emotions and design moments you can hold in your hand.</p>
    <h2>Our creations live in three worlds:</h2>
    <ol>
        <p> 1. Perfumes that carry your personality in every note.</p>
        <p> 2. Personalised gifts that speak without words.</p>
        <p> 3. Books that hold wisdom, imagination, and soul.</p>
    </ol>
    <p>Every product passes through the same hands that dreamed of making this brand a reality by ensuring it’s personal, premium and purposeful.</p>
    <p>But 103 Creations is also part of something bigger. The <strong>103 Arcology Project</strong> a vision to build not just a business, but a community and legacy that uplifts others. From small gifts to global ideas, everything we make is a step towards that dream.</p>
    <p>Because here, you’re not just buying a product. You’re carrying a story and now, it’s yours to tell.</p>
    <h2>Who it’s for?</h2>
    <p>Riders, builders, people who prefer progress over noise. REVV103 is subtle up close, steady over hours, and never loud in a room.</p>
